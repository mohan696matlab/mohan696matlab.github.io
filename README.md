## Projects

### SNCF - AI-Based Track Condition Monitoring
Led the collaboration between SNCF and Université de Lille to design an AI-based track condition monitoring system. Integrated physical knowledge into the model to reduce false alarms, covering data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment on a local server.

### Image Captioning Model with Deployment
Trained an image captioning model using **TensorFlow** with **ResNet-50** and **LSTM** on the Flickr 8k dataset, generating insightful captions for images. Developed a Flask app for local deployment, allowing users to upload images and receive generated captions.

### Facial Mask Recognition App with OpenCV
Developed a real-time mask recognition system using **OpenCV** and a fine-tuned **VGG-16** network, trained on a Kaggle dataset of 1376 images. Implemented real-time face detection and classification in videos, predicting mask compliance.

### YouTube Channel - Intelligent Machines
Launched a YouTube channel dedicated to data-driven condition monitoring. Demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques such as **CNN**, **RNN**, and **GAN** for industrial fault detection and monitoring. The channel has garnered over 70,000 views and 900+ subscribers.
