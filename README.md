## Work Experience

**R&D Engineer @ BUAWEI, Lille (_Mar 2024 - Current_)**
- Developed a state-of-the-art vision anomaly detection model for real-time quality inspection in collaboration with a large automotive client, improving speed by 85% without compromising performance. Collaborated with DevOps for deployment and coordinated with the product team for post-production monitoring. Tech stack: PyTorch, CI/CD, Git, Docker, Linux.
 
- Utilized diffusion models to generate a more diverse dataset, enhancing the representation of underrepresented classes and improving model accuracy by 10-20%. 
Tech stack: Hugging Face, PyTorch, Linux, Transformers.

- Worked on various generative AI projects involving text-to-image models, image editing using generative AI, inpainting, guidance, and stable diffusion techniques. Tech stack: Hugging Face, PyTorch, Linux, Transformers.

- Led an object tracking project for an international aerospace company, delivering a real-time contamination estimation system that was 10x faster than manual methods. This method is now in production. Tech stack: OpenCV, Ultranalytics, PyTorch, CI/CD, Docker, Linux.

**Doctoral Researcher @ CRISTAL, Université de Lille (_Oct 2021 - Mar 2024_)**
- Led the collaboration between SNCF and Université de Lille to design an AI-based track condition monitoring system. Integrated physical knowledge into the model to reduce false alarms, covering data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment on a local server.

- Created a novel eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, enhancing trust in predictions for critical industrial settings, presented at an international conference.

- Applied self-supervised learning to develop a hybrid fault diagnosis method, incorporating physics-based models, reducing the need for labelled data by 70%.


## Projects

### YouTube Channel - Intelligent Machines
Launched a YouTube channel dedicated to data-driven condition monitoring. Demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques such as **CNN**, **RNN** for industrial fault detection and monitoring. 

### Image Captioning Model with Deployment
Trained an image captioning model using **TensorFlow** with **ResNet-50** and **LSTM** on the Flickr 8k dataset, generating insightful captions for images. Developed a Flask app for local deployment, allowing users to upload images and receive generated captions.

### Facial Mask Recognition App with OpenCV
Developed a real-time mask recognition system using **OpenCV** and a fine-tuned **VGG-16** network, trained on a Kaggle dataset of 1376 images. Implemented real-time face detection and classification in videos, predicting mask compliance.
